These two Simon shirts had some adjustments from the default options.

For the short sleeve, relaxed Simon that is the main image in this showcase, Laser turned up the waist ease until the back dart went away.

For short sleeve Simon #2, she increased her hips measurement and left the waist ease alone, so this one has some back darts:

She noted that Simon(e) uses hips to calculate the width at the bottom instead of seat, and with the default length the shirt ends up far enough below her hips that it's too tight because it's almost at her seat. Something to keep in mind for fellow sewists with curvy bodies!
