title: Measurements Sets Comparison
---

We can occasionally show how your sets of measurements compare to other measurements sets. Zo kunnen we mogelijke problemen in je metingen of patronen opsporen.

Comparing yourself to others is the fastest way to be unhappy, so if you'd rather not see any comparisons, you can disable this feature altogether.
