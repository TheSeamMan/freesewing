title: Measurements Sets Comparison
---

We can occasionally show how your sets of measurements compare to other measurements sets.
This allows us to detect potential problems in your measurements or patterns.

Comparing yourself to others is the fastest way to be unhappy, so if you'd
rather not see any comparisons, you can disable this feature altogether.
