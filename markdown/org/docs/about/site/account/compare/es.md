title: Measurements Sets Comparison

We can occasionally show how your sets of measurements compare to other measurements sets. Esto nos permite detectar posibles problemas en tus medidas o patrones.

Comparing yourself to others is the fastest way to be unhappy, so if you'd rather not see any comparisons, you can disable this feature altogether.
