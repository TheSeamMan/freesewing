title: User Experience
---

This setting allows you to control what sort of a user experience you want. 
One that is more simple, with advanced features hidden. Or one that has all bells and whistles.

FreeSewing is a rather advanced platform, and that can be intimidating for new users.
This setting was created to allow people to start simple, and then unlock more features later.
