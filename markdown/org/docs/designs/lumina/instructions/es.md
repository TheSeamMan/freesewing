<Note>

This is a garment made from a stretch fabric. So use appropriate seam solutions. A serger is a good way to do this, as
are specific stitches that certain sewing machines provide. A zigzag stitch will do if that's all you have.

Keep in mind that since these seams are always under tension, it may be a good idea to double them up, or
provide a zigzag in addition to serging the seam.

</Note>

### Paso 1: Los bolsillos delanteros

- Sew the two pieces to eachother, right sides together, along the top seam.
- Presiona para abrir la bragueta y la costura.
- Con los lados derechos juntos, cose las piezas traseras a lo largo de la costura trasera. This creates a loop.

<Note>
If you want to include elastic into the waistband, now is a good time to do so. You should
add it to the seam you just sewed.
</Note>

### Step 2: The cross seam

- Sew both leg pieces together along the cross seam.

### Step 3: Pockets

- Serge the top of the two panels.
- Fold this top over onto itself, and stitch in place. Using a double needle is a good way to do this.
  Zigzag works too. Make sure that you fold it slightly more than the seam allowance.
- Lay the panel down with the right side down.
- Lay the pocket part on top, right side down, aligning the notches. Fijar en su lugar
- Stitch the bottom of the pocket to the panel. Again, a double needle or zigzag works well.

### Step 4: Panels

- Align all the front notches of the panel to the front of the leg panel, right sides together.
  If you included the pocket option, make sure you treat the pocket and panel pieces as one piece.
- Seam this seam on both legs.
- Repeat for the back side of the panel and leg parts

<Note>
The number and distance of the notches on the front and back seams are different. 
</Note>

### Paso 5: Botones

- Plancha el margen de costura inferior hacia el revés de la pieza restante de la cintura. Align the notches with the panel seams.
- Plancha la cintura y el margen de costura hacia arriba y lejos de la pierna. Asegúrate de dejar un hueco debajo de las muescas en la parte inferior de las costuras laterales. This seam will combine three layers, both layers of the waistband, and one layer of the leg
  pieces.

<Note>
If you have included the pocket option, take extra care not to sew the folded over part of the panel into
the waistband seam.

### Paso 6: ¡Disfrútalo!

Now you can add the elastic to the leg openings. Otherwise finish those in any way you like.

Todo listo! Enjoy your Lumina leggings!
