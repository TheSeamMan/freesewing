### Hauptstoff

This pattern requires a stretch fabric. The stretch needs to be perpendicular to the grainline. There is no stretch required along
the grainline, but a 4-way stretch fabric can definitely be used. Not all stretch fabrics have the same amount of stretch. The default
ease value of -10% works well for fabrics that have 40% stretch. If your fabric has a different amount of stretch, you may want to adjust this setting accordingly. Reduce the ease when your fabric has more stretch. Getting the ease right is _very_ important for
getting a good fit.

<Note>

If the ease setting is larger than 0 (positive ease), any type of knit fabric can be used. Keep in mind that even with the ease
set at the maximum, you probably will not be able to use a fabric with no stretch at all (a woven fabric).

</Note>

These fabrics come in different weights. Pick one that works for how you intend to use it. Thicker fabrics provide more support
and warmth.

For yoga pants, take something that has a medium thickness. Supplex is a good choice for this. It also works well for cycling. For
other athletics use fabrics that would be appropriate for that. Most fabrics that contain spandex will work.

<Note>

Since this pattern has an outside panel, you can use contrasting fabrics to make interesting effects.
