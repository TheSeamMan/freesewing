title: "Tristan top: What You Need"
---

To make Tristan, you will need the following:

- [Basis naaimateriaal](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable main fabric (see [Fabric options](/docs/designs/tristan/fabric))
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable lining fabric (if lining)
- Choice of closure - either **Zipper**, or **eyelets**, **reinforcement for the eyelets**, and **lacing**
- If finishing with bias binding, **Bias tape** (about 4 meters (4.4 yards))

<Tip>

##### Use a separating zipper

We recommend a separating invisible zipper for this garment. Using a separating zipper will make it easier for you to take the top on and off.

##### When making Tristan with the lacing option, reinforce the eyelets

When making Tristan with the lacing option, make sure you reinforce the eyelets. A binding, or sewn in interfacing could work to do so. Adding boning between the eyelets and the seam is another option.

Tristan is not a corset, and therefore doesn't require heavy boning. We would recommend using a flexible type of boning. That would create the neatest opening. Otherwise a double layer of hair canvas and put the eyelets close to the seam. Both would require lining, or an adequately sized hem or binding.
