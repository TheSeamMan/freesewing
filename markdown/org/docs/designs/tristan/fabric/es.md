title: "Tristan top: Fabric Options"
---

Tristan is designed for woven fabrics with little to no stretch.

For the **main fabric**, you can use most non-stretch fabrics, such as poplin, jacquard, or linen. Even quilting cotton will work. Fabrics with some structure will work best.

For the **lining**, if you would like a firm structure even without the use of boning, use a strong fabric, such as canvas, twill, or denim. Use something that will be comfortable against the skin.

<Tip>

##### Consider using contrasting fabrics

Consider using different fabrics for the inside and outside panels to highlight the prince(ss) seams.
