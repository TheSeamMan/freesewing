title: "Waralee Wickelhose: Designer Notes"
---

Waralee is one of those designs that you just make because it's easy, and you feel like there must be tons of other people who would love to make wrap pants. And where can you find wrap pants with pockets? Und wer will schon eine Hose ohne Taschen?

Die Konstruktion ist einfach, wenn du sie ohne Taschen machst. And with them, it's still not that hard for a practiced sewist.

Keep in mind that `waralee` is basically two large rectangles, and you can easily make them by transferring the pattern onto fabric by using the dimensions, and not printing out all the pages. Turn off the `expand` option in the core settings and you'll get a page with all the dimensions on it to mark your fabric. And a handy template for the crotch cut-out is provided too.

Diese Wickelhosen sind bei warmem Wetter besonders sch√∂n, vor allem wenn sie aus Leinen sind.
