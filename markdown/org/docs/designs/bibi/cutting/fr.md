- **Ribbing**
  - Cut 1 _Neck Binding_
  - Depending on how you want to finish the neck and armholes, choose an appropriate seam allowance.
  - Cut 1 _Waistband_ (if enabled)

## Avertissements

- There is extra hem allowance at the bottom hem if there is no _Waistband_ part.
- There is extra hem allowance at the sleeve part if there is no _Cuff_ part.
- Il n'y a pas d'autorisation de couture sur l'encolure.
- There is no sleeve part if sleeves are disabled or the sleeve length setting is below 5%
- There is no seam allowance on the long sides of the _Armhole Binding_ and _Neck Binding_ parts.

<Note>
You can cut the front or back parts on the fold, or you can cut the halves separately and sew them together. This is especially
useful if you only have smaller pieces of fabric or if you want to add buttons or zippers to your design. In this case, make sure
to add sufficient seam allowance on the center fold.
