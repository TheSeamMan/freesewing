<Note>
You can cut the front or back parts on the fold, or you can cut the halves separately and sew them together. This is especially
useful if you only have smaller pieces of fabric or if you want to add buttons or zippers to your design. In this case, make sure
to add sufficient seam allowance on the center fold.
