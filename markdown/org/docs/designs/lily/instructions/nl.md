<Note>

Dit is een kledingstuk van stretchstof. Gebruik dus de geschikte naadoplossingen. A serger is a good way to do this, as
are specific stitches that certain sewing machine provide. Een zigzagsteek is voldoende als dat alles is wat je hebt.

Keep in mind that since these seams are always under tension, it may be a good idea to double them up, or
provide a zigzag in addition to serging the seam.

### Step 1: Construct the legs

Open the legs out after sewing the crotch and cross seams to make it easy to sew the inseam and side seams.
