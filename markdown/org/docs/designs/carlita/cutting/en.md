<Comment by="Benjamin F.">

Instead of cutting the canvas parts nett, there is an alternate
method where seam allowance is included on the canvas parts.
The idea is that because the canvas parts have seam allowance,
when they are attached to the main fabric pieces this can allow
ease to be worked into the garment for a better shape.
The seam allowance is then trimmed from the canvas at a later point
in the garment construction process.

However, because this is a more advanced tailoring technique,
our instructions are instead written with the nett canvas method.
