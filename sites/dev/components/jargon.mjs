 *   - key: holds the jargon term (make sure to lowercase it and strip dots)
 *   - value: holds the path to the documentation page as when browsing the website
 *
 * To be clear:
 *   - You need to first create a markdown page explaining the term.
 *   - Only afterwards can you add it here
 *   - Since this uses dynamic MDX loaded from GitHub,it won't work until pushed
