/*
 * Note that we are creating this above as 'Naomiwu' and not 'NaomiWu', which
 * would be the correctly camel-cased name of the person it's named after.
 *
 * The reason is that when discussing the name with Naomi, she originally
 * suggested 'Open Cargo Skirt'. After explaining that we typically use
 * first-names for our designs because we provide a website in multiple
 * languages and want to have a name that does not need translation, she
 * suggested either 'Wu Cargo Skirt' or 'Naomi Wu Cargo Skirt'.
 *
 * So we landed on 'Naomi Wu Cargo Skirt' which makes the short name of this
 * pattern (as used in the NPM package and URLs) 'naomiwu'.
 * To get the constructor from that, we capitalize the design name, so that
 * is why 'Naomiwu' is exported.
 *
 * However, to be flexible, we also export this design as NaomiWu below.
 * This way, both ways work.
